\chapter{Case Study}

\section{History of case study}
Informatics Research Center (IRC) was formed on May 9, 2018. The IRC Formation Polytechnic Lecturer and Pos Indonesia conducting formatting and concept formation in the Laboratory IRC IRC to carry out a series of studies. IRC is a research program initiated by the faculty of Informatics Polytechnic Pos Indonesia. The program is much related to technology and research.
\par
By using technology that is already stable, the research process can run as well as solving the problems that exist around. Some issues related to the research has been conceptualized from professors and formation IRC to realize the VISION and MISSION IRC.
