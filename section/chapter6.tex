\section{Conclussion of Problems}
\par
        By paying attention to data processing and analysis in the previous chapter it can be concluded that wavelet is a signal processing method that requires work methods similar to Fourier signal decomposition can be used to identify how a person's brain is a drug user or not a drug user. 
        
\section{Conclusion of Method}
\par
The conclusions obtained in this research method are where the researcher determines the method used to process the data from the object determined by the research will determine the quality of the research. In this step the researcher can find out more, by observing, reading the literature identifying one predetermined aspect with relevant environmental (drug users) relevan.

\section{Conclusion of Experiment}
\par
In this study, eeg signals that have been recorded using WINEEG and analysis using WAVELET can be concluded that the condition of the otas of the person being studied can be observed. Observations made by comparing the results of the subject's brain data record before and after being given a stimulus. This analysis also shows large variations due to drugs or methadone. Therefore, the use of the proposed method, the assessment of the brain condition of drug users using WAVELET, the brain condition of drug users and the identification of efficient EEG signals can help in research.
