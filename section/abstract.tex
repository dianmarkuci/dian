Electroensephalogram (EEG) is an activity to record the electrical activity of brain neurons. EEG is often used to analyze brain activity and predict the emotions produced, by using EEG relaxed conditions of drug users can be observed. EEG signals are widely used to detect brain disorders in the health world. However, the signal produced by the EEG needs to be prepared for the process to be able to detect brain abnormalities automatically. Therefore, there is a need for a preprocessing method to produce the right features in order to obtain precisely and accurately stored characteristics of the EEG signal. This research will be developed using the Loreta method. Therefore, the researcher will design portable devices and application systems that can monitor the condition of the brain using EEG sensors correctly.
